# OIBSIP_DataScience_Task2 - Car Price Prediction using ML

## 🎯 Objective
Predict the selling price of a used car based on features like present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, etc.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Regressor
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Steps Performed
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Performed feature engineering (e.g., created `Car_Age`)
3. Encoded categorical variables
4. Trained a Random Forest model
5. Evaluated model performance using R² score
6. Built a simple user input interface (optional)

## ✅ Outcome
Achieved high accuracy in predicting prices with Random Forest. Demonstrated understanding of regression, feature encoding, and model evaluation.
